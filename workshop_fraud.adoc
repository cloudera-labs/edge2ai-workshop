= Credit Card Fraud Detection Demo

Currently, this use case is a demo rather than a workshop. You can quickly deploy the demo implementation and demo or play around with it.

There's no step-by-step instructions on how to build this, _yet_. If you are willing to contribute with the workshop content this will be greatly appreciated. Please get in touch.

== Preparation

This demo uses link:https://account.mapbox.com/[MapBox] to show the distribution of fraud occurrences on an interactive map.
To enable this a MapBox token is required so that Cloudera DataViz can connect to the MapBox service.
If you don't yet have a token, click on the MapBox link above, sign up for free and create a token for yourself.

To deploy the demo please SSH to your cluster host and run the following command:

NOTE: The command below will undo everything done in the cluster in previous workshops.

[source,shell]
----
MAPBOX_TOKEN=<your_mapbox_token> /tmp/resources/reset-to-lab.sh fraud 99
----
// Comments:
// Latest tries with MapBox indicate: 
// a) troubles when signing up. Only after several tries I was Able to sign up
// b) Various errors encountered when running the reset-to-lab script
// First 502 "bad gateway", then 404 page not found.
// Tried to generate an access key with all the "hidden scopes" enabled, no more sucess with that
